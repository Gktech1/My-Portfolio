Write a function that takes in a string and returns its longest substring without duplicate characters.

You can assume that there will only be one longest substring without duplication.

Sample Input
string = "clementisacap"

Sample Output
"mentisac"
As you can see from the input above, the longest string we can take from the word that does not contain any duplicate characters is mentisac

Try to do this in linear time
